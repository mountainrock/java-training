 Questions and Answers: Operators, Conditional Statements, and For Loops in Java

Operators:

1. What are the different types of operators in Java?
   Java has several types of operators:
     * Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, % (modulus)
     * Relational Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
     * Logical Operators: && (AND), || (OR), ! (NOT)
     * Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
     * Increment and Decrement Operators: ++, --
     * Conditional (Ternary) Operator: ?:

Conditional Statements:

2. Explain the if-else statement in Java with an example.
   The if-else statement allows you to execute different blocks of code based on a condition.
  Example:
   
   int age = 20;
   if (age >= 18) {
       System.out.println("You are elder");
   } else {
       System.out.println("You are a child.");
   }
   

3. What is the difference between the if-else statement and the switch statement?
   The if-else statement is used for simple conditional checks based on true/false conditions.
   The switch statement is used for multi-way branching based on different values of a variable.

4. How do you handle multiple conditions using the else if ?
    The else if  allows you to check multiple conditions one after the other until a true condition is found.
    Example:
   
   int score = 85;
   if (score >= 90) {
       System.out.println("Excellent!");
   } else if (score >= 80) {
       System.out.println("Good job!");
   } else if (score >= 70) {
       System.out.println("Keep it up!");
   } else {
       System.out.println("You can do better!");
   }
   

For Loops:

5. Explain the basic for loop in Java with an example.
    The basic for loop is used for iterating a block of code a specific number of times.Repeating
    Example:
   
   for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
       System.out.println("Iteration #" + i);
   }

  int i=1;

   
6. How do you use the enhanced for loop (for-each loop) in Java?
   The enhanced for loop is used to iterate over elements in an array or a collection.
   * Example:
   
   int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
   for (int num : numbers) {
        System.out.print(num + " ");
   }
   // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
   

7. What is the difference between the break and continue statements in a loop?
    The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.
    The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration in the loop.

8. How do you implement nested for loops?
    Nested for loops are used to create complex patterns or perform nested iterations.
    Example:
   
   for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
       for (int j = 1; j <= 3; j++) {
           System.out.println("i: " + i + ", j: " + j);
       }
   }
